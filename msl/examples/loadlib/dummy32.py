"""
A *dummy* example of a 32-bit server.

Example of a server that is executed by a 32-bit Python interpreter that receives
requests from the corresponding :mod:`~.dummy64` module which can be run by a 64-bit
Python interpreter.

:class:`~.dummy32.Dummy32` is the 32-bit server class and :class:`~.dummy64.Dummy64` is
the 64-bit client class. These *dummy* classes do not actually communicate with a shared
library. The point of these *dummy* classes is to show that a Python data type in a
64-bit process appears as the same data type in the 32-bit process and vice versa.
